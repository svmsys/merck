#Task 1.

Use “Robot Framework” as test automation framework to automate test without using automation recorders or code generators:
Go to your favorite e-shop, navigate to some category and add two
most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category.
Provide code from implementation.

Note: Implemented based on WebDriver I/O and Jasmine.

#Task 2.

Write a program in any programming language that counts backwards from value provided by user to 1 and prints: “Agile” if the number is divisible by 5, “Software” if the
number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both,
or prints just the number if none of those cases are true.

Note: Implemented by using TypeScript.
